# marine-data-learning

This repo documents my journey learning data science through real-world research focused on fisheries, vessel tracking, and ocean sustainability.

##  Project Goal

Iâ€™m investigating the presence of **European-owned super trawlers** operating under the **Senegalese flag** or using **flags of convenience**, and comparing their fishing effort to vessels from **China** and **Senegal** or other fishers.

By combining:
- Public fleet registries
- AIS-based fishing effort data (via Global Fishing Watch)
- Vessel metadata (names, types, flags, ports, etc.)
I aim to identify patterns of foreign industrial fishing in West African waters.

## Notes

- This is a learning project but based on real data and real policy concerns.
- The repo will evolve as I learn more about Python, data science, and fisheries research.
